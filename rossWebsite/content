We grow far better than any organic certification, and invite you to come out and volunteer or tour our beautiful farm to see how our consciously grown food can enrich your life. We never spray with any toxic chemicals and plant in nutrient dense, living soil to create the healthiest plants, and thus food, for you and your family.

About Us

            We we are

We are a team of young and fresh individuals who are pushing the envelope with how we grow food. We heavily incorporate permaculture, biodynamics, and spirituality into our 3 acre market style garden.

 

The inspired leader, “Farmer Ross”, has his Master’s in Business Entrepreneurship from Texas A&M and is a Certified Advanced Permaculture Designer. He is continually learning to become a more efficient and ecological farmer.

 

We currently grow on 2 properties in Denton, County. We have a 15,000 square foot greenhouse where we grow year-round, and 3 acres of field production dedicated to permaculture and biodynamics. We grow fruits, vegetables, and raise ducks for eggs! 

 

            Growing Practices

 

            <p>We take pride in our cutting edge technology of producing the healthiest plants.Some of the ways we do this include: </p>

 
            <ul>
                  <li><b>Soil Microbiology:</b> the backbone of any farm is the soil, and good soil is made up not only of nutrients, but living micro organisms. At MMF, we partner with the microbes to grow our plants. We regularly grow,  feed, and use microscopy to analyze the microbial content of our soils. Healthy Soil = Health Plants.</li>
                  <li>We make our own fungal dominant, microbial rich compost through the most advanced methods possible: Elaine Ingham style compost, Johnson Su Bio Reactor, and of course, vermicomposting.</li>

                  <li><b>EM and BioChar:</b> we use specific Effective Microbes (EM) and BioChar,  a honeycomb charcoal substance, to enrich our compost, duck yard, and soils to be a better home for our microbes.</li>

                  

                  <li><b>Ellen White Tree Planting:</b> for all of our trees and shrubs, we plant them via the “Ellen White Method”. This methods came to Ellen White in a Dream in the 1800s while studying with aboriginals in Australia. In 3 years time, this method can produce 20 times the growth, productivity, and nutrients than conventionally planted trees.</li>

                  

                  <li><b>Integrated Animal Partnership:</b> with the use of our ducks, we are able to provide the garden with nutrients and pest management.</li>

                  

                  <li><b>Ceremonial Practices:</b> One of the things that make MMF so unique are our spiritually focused practices. We know to truly make the change we desire in this world, we must change ourselves. We use ceremonial practices to continually bring in a higher Presence into our lives and farm, and to touch the world with beauty.</li>
            </ul>
